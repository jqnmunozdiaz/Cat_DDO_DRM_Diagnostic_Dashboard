  "0000": "In {country}, the diagnostic suggests that the foundational elements of the DRM system are largely absent. There is no legal basis defining roles, no dedicated funding for coordination, and no approved DRM strategies or regulations. The overall environment indicates an early institutional stage with significant gaps across legal, financial, and policy dimensions.",
  "0001": "In {country}, DRM-related regulations exist, but the broader enabling environment remains weak. There is no overarching legal framework, no dedicated funding for the lead institution, and no approved DRM strategy. Regulations offer operational guidance, but they are not supported by the higher-level instruments needed for coherence and authority.",
  "0010": "In {country}, an officially approved DRM strategy or policy is in place, but it lacks the necessary legal backing, institutional resourcing, and regulatory framework. As a result, the strategy may guide intentions but is unlikely to be fully implemented due to insufficient institutional foundations.",
  "0011": "In {country}, DRM strategies and regulations have been formally approved, indicating emerging policy and operational structure. However, without a legal basis or dedicated funding for the coordinating institution, implementation capacity remains limited. Policy development is progressing, but institutional and financial anchors are still weak.",
  "0100": "In {country}, the lead DRM institution receives dedicated funding, which is positive. Yet the absence of a legal framework, approved strategies, and approved regulations suggests that resourcing is not embedded within a structured system. Funding supports activities, but institutional clarity and strategic direction remain missing.",
  "0101": "In {country}, the coordinating institution receives funding and operates under certain approved DRM regulations. However, without a formal legal framework and an approved strategy, the system remains incomplete. Operational rules exist and are financed, but they lack integration within a coherent legal and policy environment.",
  "0110": "In {country}, the DRM coordinating entity benefits from dedicated funding and an approved strategy that provides strategic direction. Still, in the absence of a legal framework and regulations, institutional roles remain unclear and operational procedures may be inconsistent. Strategic intent is present but insufficiently institutionalized.",
  "0111": "In {country}, the system benefits from dedicated institutional funding, a formal strategy, and approved regulations. These elements support coordinated action. However, the lack of a foundational legal framework weakens authority, enforcement capacity, and long-term institutional continuity.",
  "1000": "In {country}, a DRM legal framework exists, offering a basis for defining roles and responsibilities. Yet without dedicated funding, approved strategies, or regulations, implementation remains limited. The legal structure is in place, but operationalization is still underdeveloped.",
  "1001": "In {country}, the DRM system has both a legal foundation and operational regulations, creating a structured environment for defining roles and guiding procedures. Still, the lack of funding and an approved strategy constrains implementation capacity and long-term prioritization.",
  "1010": "In {country}, a legal framework and an approved DRM strategy provide both the mandate and strategic direction for DRM. However, the absence of funding and regulations limits operational capacity and internal coordination. The system is conceptually well-developed but under-resourced.",
  "1011": "In {country}, the legal framework, strategy, and regulations together form a solid institutional and policy architecture. However, the lack of dedicated funding for the coordinating institution restricts execution. The system is well-designed on paper but financially constrained.",
  "1100": "In {country}, the existence of a legal framework and dedicated funding for the coordinating institution represents strong institutional foundations. Yet without a strategy and regulations, the system lacks strategic coherence and formal operational guidance. The core structure is present but insufficiently articulated.",
  "1101": "In {country}, the legal framework, dedicated funding, and approved regulations create a solid environment for institutional functioning. However, the absence of an approved strategy limits long-term planning and prioritization. The system is institutionally robust but strategically incomplete.",
  "1110": "In {country}, the legal basis, institutional resourcing, and strategic direction are in place, enabling coordinated DRM implementation. Nonetheless, the absence of operational regulations may result in inconsistencies in roles and procedures. The architecture is strong but requires further codification.",
  "1111": "In {country}, all core components of the DRM institutional environment are in place: a legal framework, dedicated funding, a formally approved strategy, and up-to-date regulations. This combination indicates a mature and coherent system with clear roles, strategic direction, operational guidance, and financial support. Institutional capacity for DRM is likely to be strong."

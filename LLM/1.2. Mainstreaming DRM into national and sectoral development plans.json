    "00": "Neither the national development strategy nor the strategic plans of key government entities integrate objectives or indicators related to disaster risk management or climate change adaptation. This suggests that risk considerations are largely absent from national planning processes, limiting the country’s ability to systematically address vulnerabilities across sectors.",
    "01": "Some essential government entities have started incorporating DRM or climate adaptation targets into their strategic plans, but the national development strategy does not yet reflect these priorities. This creates a fragmented approach where sectoral progress is not anchored in national-level direction, reducing coherence and long-term alignment.",
    "10": "The national development strategy includes objectives or indicators related to DRM or climate adaptation. However, fewer than half of essential government entities have integrated these priorities into their own planning documents. This indicates a top-down commitment that has not yet been fully translated into sectoral implementation.",
    "11": "Both the national development strategy and the majority of essential government entities explicitly incorporate DRM or climate adaptation priorities in their strategic plans. This alignment demonstrates a strong mainstreaming of risk considerations across levels of government, supporting a coherent and coordinated approach to resilience."

    "0000": "Territorial and urban planning instruments are developed without mandatory use of risk information, official methodologies, or guidelines for high-risk areas. Moreover, recent planning instruments have not incorporated risk data. Overall, risk-informed planning is largely absent.",
    "0001": "Recent planning instruments have used risk information, but there are no laws mandating it, no official methodologies, and no guidelines for high-risk areas. Some implementation occurs, but it is ad hoc and not systematically embedded in planning processes.",
    "0010": "Official methodologies exist to guide risk-informed planning, but laws, guidelines for high-risk areas, and use of risk information in recent instruments are lacking. Planning guidance is available, yet it is rarely applied or enforced.",
    "0011": "Official methodologies exist and some recent instruments have used risk information, but laws mandating risk integration and guidelines for high-risk areas are absent. Implementation is partially guided but lacks legal and procedural anchors.",
    "0100": "Guidelines for managing housing and settlements in high-risk areas exist, but laws, official methodologies, and use of risk information in recent instruments are missing. Planning is partially informed by risk for high-risk settlements, but integration is limited.",
    "0101": "Guidelines exist and some recent instruments have used risk information, yet laws and official methodologies are absent. Risk considerations are applied in practice, but without formal legal or methodological support.",
    "0110": "Both official methodologies and guidelines for high-risk areas exist, but laws mandating risk integration and recent instrument use are missing. Risk-informed planning is guided, but implementation remains inconsistent and non-mandatory.",
    "0111": "Official methodologies, guidelines for high-risk areas, and some recent instruments using risk information are present, but laws mandating risk integration are still absent. Planning shows good practice, though legal enforcement is lacking.",
    "1000": "Laws mandate the use of risk information in planning, but official methodologies, guidelines, and recent instrument use are missing. Legal requirements exist, but practical implementation is limited and guidance is insufficient.",
    "1001": "Laws mandate risk integration and recent instruments have used risk information, but official methodologies and high-risk guidelines are absent. Legal requirements are applied in practice, though planning support is incomplete.",
    "1010": "Laws mandate risk-informed planning and official methodologies exist, but guidelines for high-risk areas and use in recent instruments are missing. Planning has a solid legal and methodological foundation, but operational application is limited.",
    "1011": "Laws and methodologies exist, and some recent instruments have incorporated risk information, but guidelines for high-risk areas are lacking. Risk-informed planning is well established legally and methodologically, though some procedural gaps remain.",
    "1100": "Laws mandate risk integration and guidelines for high-risk areas exist, but official methodologies and recent instrument use are missing. Legal and procedural frameworks support planning in high-risk zones, but methodological guidance and implementation are incomplete.",
    "1101": "Laws and guidelines exist and some recent instruments have used risk information, but official methodologies are missing. Risk-informed planning is guided by law and high-risk procedures, though technical guidance is incomplete.",
    "1110": "Laws, official methodologies, and guidelines for high-risk areas exist, but recent instruments have not consistently used risk information. Planning is institutionally and technically well supported, but practical application in recent instruments is limited.",
    "1111": "All core elements are in place: laws mandating risk use, official methodologies, guidelines for high-risk areas, and recent instruments incorporating risk information. This indicates a comprehensive, risk-informed approach to territorial and urban planning in {country}."
